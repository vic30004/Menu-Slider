# Menu-Slider

This application is a static website created to implement a menu slider and modal. Since these are one of the most commanly used features, I wanted to practice them and reinforce my knowledge.

# Tech Used

For this application, I used HTML, CSS and JS. I also used the randomuser.me api to generate the random profile picture.

# How It Works

This is a very simple app. To use simply click on the burger menu icon on the top left or click on the sign up button. Clicking the menu icon will trigger the nav bar to slide into view from the left. Clicking the Sign up model will open the modal.
